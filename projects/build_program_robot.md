## Parts

To begin, the parts you will need for this robot are found in the list below:
* Arduino Uno R3[A000066]
* Adafruit TB6612 1.2A DC/Stepper Motor Driver
* Bread Board
* Jumper Wires
* Robot Car Chassis kit including:
  * Two DC motors 
  * Two wheels with counter weights for balancing
  * Various nuts and bolts for assembly
  * Caster Wheel
  * Battery Box

## Assembly

**Please read each step to completion before beginning to assemble.**

### Step 1

First, start with the two yellow DC motors. In your kit, there should be two aluminum mounting brackets with multiple holes drilled out. There will also be four long screws. To attach the aluminum block to the DC motor, align it with the holes on the side of the DC motor where the connectors are and push the screw through the opposite side and tighten with a bolt. Place the black disk on the same side as the mounting bracket.
 
Make sure these are in the correct orientation, meaning the bolt side will be pointing to the center of the chassis with the mounting block and connectors pointing towards the center as well. Also, make sure the mounting bracket screw holes at the up towards the bottom of the chassis. If it is in the wrong orientation, then the block and bolts will interfere with the wheels and not connect to the chassis correctly.

### Step 2

Now attach the DC motors to the chassis, where the connectors are pointed toward the front of the chassis. 
This will require 1cm screws and bolts. Put the screws through the top side of the chassis plate and bolts in the 
bottom. Then attach the mounting bracket to the end of the screws with the bolts still in place. The bolts act as 
spacers to make sure there is clearance for the disk, so it doesn't conflict with the chassis. Then connect positive 
and negative wires to the connectors on the DC motors. 



Reference \textbf{Figure \ref{chasismotor}} to double check you have done this correctly. 


Then, feed the wires from under the chassis to the top through the T-shaped holes.
