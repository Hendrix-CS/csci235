For your final project, you should program your robot to fulfill a goal. The
nature of the goal is deliberately open-ended. Here are the project guidelines:

* You may work solo, or you may work in a team with up to two other students in the
  class, hence up to three people total.
* As the project earns an Odyssey Special Projects (SP) credit, there is a 
  **minimum** of thirty hours of work on the part of **each** team member. You 
  should maintain a journal to document this.
* The topic selection is very open, and ultimately can be anything upon which you 
  and the instructor agree. It should be "contextualized"; that is, it should 
  involve the application of robotics techniques towards a larger goal.
* You may augment your robot with any hardware that you acquire.

## Project Proposal

Each project proposal should include the following:
* Team Members
* A few paragraphs describing the project goals
* A proposed timeline for completing the project, including intermediate goals

## Final Paper

Each team submits **one** final project paper. It should include the following:
* Project goals
* Description of the metrics (qualitative and/or quantitative) used for determining
  project completion.
* Degree to which each goal was completed.
* Description of how the robot was programmed, and how that programming supported
  each goal.
* Description of challenges encountered and how they were addressed.
* Project log, documenting the following:
  * Start/end times of each work session.
  * Goals and accomplishments for each work session.
  * Participants in each work session.
  * Each participant must document **30 hours of work**.
* A conclusion summarizing the project.

## Final Presentation

During the final exam period for the course (Wednesday, May 5, 2-5 pm) each 
student/team will deliver an oral presentation as follows:
* Project goals
* Degree of completion of goals
* Description of challenges encountered and how they were addressed
* Presentation of video recordings of the robot in action.
* Conclusion summarizing the project.
