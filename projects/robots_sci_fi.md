## Description

Portrayals of robots in science fiction have heavily influenced the field of robotics.
In this assignment, you will compare and contrast several such portrayals of robots with
examples of commercially and scientifically deployed robots.

## Fiction Works

* Select two short stories from our list.
* Also select an additional example of a robot from a book or movie with which you are familiar.

For each work, answer the following questions:
* What purpose do humans envision for robots in that setting?
* In what ways do the robots:
  * Fulfill that purpose? 
  * Introduce unexpected complications?

## Deployed Robots

Select two types of robot from the list below:
* Mars Rovers (e.g. [Spirit](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-exploration-rover-spirit-mer-spirit/), 
  [Opportunity](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-exploration-rover-opportunity-mer/), 
  [Curiosity](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/))
* Warehouse robots (e.g. [Locus](https://locusrobotics.com/about-us/), [Kiva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KRjuuEVEZs))
* [Roomba](https://www.irobot.com/roomba)
* Telepresence robots (e.g. [Ava](https://www.avarobotics.com/))
* Security robots (e.g. [Vigilus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedkNzsT9f4), [Knightscope](https://www.knightscope.com/))

Answer the following questions:
* For each robot, what is its purpose and what are its capabilities?
* What similarities and differences are there between these two robots?

## Analysis

Drawing upon your earlier answers, answer the following questions:
* What aspects uniquely define what it means to be a robot?
* Under what circumstances are robots useful?
* When *should* robots be used?
