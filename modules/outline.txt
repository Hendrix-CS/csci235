Possible outline of activities

Activity 1: Subscription
- IR, Battery, Python

Activity 2: Publication
- Communication via topics
- Curses UI
- Publishing to cmd_vel
- Hazards
- Building an obstacle avoider

Activity 3: Fuzzy Logic
- Odometry
- Aim and drive to point
- Fuzzy with IR

Activity 4: Mode selection/State machines
- See https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci235/projects/modes.html
- Avoid2Way
  - When IR senses an obstacle, move away from it based on last bump sensor
  - Now that we've done fuzzy logic, we can incorporate that based on
    which bumper was last hit.
- Avoid2WayDelay
  - Longer turns using odometry
- Patrol1
  - Patrol along a line
    - Maybe along a wall
  - 2 meters, 180 degree turn, indefinitely
- Patrol2
  - Can't really do the track
- Patrol3
  - Turn early if obstacle detected
- Additional patrols
  - 2D area
