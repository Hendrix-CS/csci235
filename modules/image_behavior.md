For this module, use the image matcher from 
[Module 8]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/image_rewards.html) as follows:
* You may program the robot to do anything you would like, so long as at least
  some of its behavior is controlled by classification of images.
* You should subscribe to at least two topics beyond the image-labeling topic. 
  Both subscriptions should impact the robot's behavior in at least some
  circumstances.
* You may use any concept we have explored in any of the course modules. If you
  choose to use Q-learning, what you do must go beyond it in some way - perhaps 
  Q-learning is only employed for action selection in certain circumstances.

## Evaluation
* Design an experiment (along the lines of those in Modules 7 and 8) to assess
the robot's performance.

In your final document for the module, include the following:
* Discuss your task
  * How does your image database help the robot achieve the task?
    * What was your strategy for collecting and labeling pictures?
  * How do the other two topics you subscribe to help the robot achieve the task?
* How does the robot perform at the task?
  * Discuss the design and results of your experiment to assess it.
