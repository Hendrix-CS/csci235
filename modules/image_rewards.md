<!-- Concept 

* Students are given a program that takes pictures and annotates them
with labels. We can also view the pictures.
* Students specify rewards associated with each picture.
* Then we run Q-Learning
  * At each time step, we ask the image database for our current reward.
  * We then observe the emergent behavior.
  
TODO list:
* Write a program to take the pictures.
* Write a program to view the pictures.
* Write a ROS2 node that monitors incoming images, publishing the 
  best-matching label at each image acquisition.
* Put together the q-learner.
