<!-- Concept 

Q-learning states are squares based on odometry.
Positive rewards for low IR values.
Small positive reward for maintaining the current direction of movement.
Negative rewards for high IR values.
Negative rewards for hitting things.

One could then path-plan by using BFS or A* on the Q-states.
