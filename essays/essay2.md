At this point in the semester, you have learned how to navigate a robot through
an area that it has mapped. Drawing upon this experience, write an essay along
the following lines:
1. Write an introduction in which you give a 1-2 sentence summary of Modules 4,
5, and 6 as well as Project 2.
2. Based on your experiences with those assignments, what do you think are the
best ideas for producing effective robot behavior that involves navigating 
between widely separated locations? Give detailed examples of both successes and 
failures from your implementation experiences to demonstrate your points.
3. Out of all of those programs, which do you think produced the most **effective**
robot behavior for its intended purpose? Why?
4. Write a conclusion in which you summarize what you have learned about robot
programming in general at this point in the course. Also write 2-3 sentences
looking ahead - what are you hoping to be able to learn to do next?
