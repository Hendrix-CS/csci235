## Description

Portrayals of robots in science fiction have heavily influenced the field of robotics.
In this assignment, you will compare and contrast several such portrayals of robots with
examples of commercially and scientifically deployed robots.

## Fiction Works

* Select two short stories from our list.
* Also select an additional example of a robot from a book or movie with which you are familiar.

For each work, answer the following questions:
* What purpose do humans envision for robots in that setting?
* In what ways do the robots:
  * Fulfill that purpose? 
  * Introduce unexpected complications?
  
Then for all three works, answer the following questions:
* What are the similarities and differences between the settings?
* How do those similarities and differences impact how humans envision robots in that setting?

## Deployed Robots

Select two robots from the categories in the list below. Each robot should be from a different category:
* Mars Rovers (e.g. [Spirit](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-exploration-rover-spirit-mer-spirit/), 
  [Opportunity](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-exploration-rover-opportunity-mer/), 
  [Curiosity](https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/))
* Warehouse robots (e.g. [Locus](https://locusrobotics.com/about-us/), [Kiva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KRjuuEVEZs))
* Household robots (e.g. [Roomba](https://www.irobot.com/roomba))
* Telepresence robots (e.g. [Ava](https://www.avarobotics.com/))
* Security robots (e.g. [Vigilus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jedkNzsT9f4), [Knightscope](https://www.knightscope.com/))
* Humanoid robots (e.g. [Atlas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPVC4IyRTG8))

Answer the following questions:
* For each robot, what is its purpose and what are its capabilities?
* What similarities and differences are there between these two robots?

## Analysis

Drawing upon your earlier answers with regard to both the fictional and deployed robots, answer the following questions:
* What aspects uniquely define what it means to be a robot?
* Under what circumstances are robots useful?
* When *should* robots be used?

## Details
* Submit in PDF format via Microsoft Teams in MLA format, 12 point font, double-spaced.
* Minimum 3 full pages in length.
