At this point in the semester, you have learned how to program a robot
that learns from experience. Drawing upon this experience, write an essay 
along the following lines:

1. Write an introduction in which you give a 1-2 sentence summary of Modules
7, 8, and 9.
2. Based on your experiences with those assignments, what do you think are
some best practices for producing effective robot behavior through machine
learning? Give specific examples from your experiences with Q-learning and
the k-nearest-neighbor classifier for images. Discuss challenges you 
encountered as well as strategies you employed to address those challenges.
3. Given the issues you recount in part 2 with employing machine learning,
what do you think are the most appropriate situations in which machine 
learning should be employed as part of a robot control program? Supply 
details from both Modules 7, 8, and 9 as well as your experience throughout
the semester in support of your argument.
4. Write a conclusion in which you summarize your arguments and supporting
evidence from your essay.
